# Tidy Taiga

This is a simple extension, that temporarily hides empty user stories from
sprint view of Taiga.io or any self-hosted version of it. To activate it, just
click on the extension icon. Click again to deactivate. If you applied a filter,
reload the page, and then enable the extension to take effect.

It works best when you filtered a lot of tasks, and you want to see clean those
user stories with no filtered task.
